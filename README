README for LibDLauritz v0.1a

Introduction
------------

LibDLauritz is a collection of code I've written over the years. It includes many
sub-projects and classes useful for simple programs. It is intended for personal or 
educational use since it is far too simple for production-level programming.

Contents
------------

This library includes:

 * dllog - A logging framework
 * dltest - An automated testing framework

See the README files for each sub-project (titled like README_dllog) for details
on purpose and use.
